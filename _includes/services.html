                    <p> AP4L (Adaptive PETs to Protect & emPower People during Life Transitions) </p>
                       <p> This project sets out to protect online privacy for people going through serious life events. </p>

                      <p>  AP4L’s aim is to protect people from stalking, online trolls, and other serious online dangers they are exposed to when going through serious real-life events.
This three-year, £3.4 million project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council will produce three Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to support people in navigating significant life transitions, such as relationship breakdowns, developing a serious illness, leaving employment in the Armed Forces, or coming out as LBGTQ+.
Experts in Cybersecurity, Psychology, Law, Business, and Criminology will collaborate in the project, which is led by the University of Surrey and the Universities of Strathclyde, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Edge Hill and Queen Mary University of London are also partners.
</p>
                    <p>  This project (Grant number: EP/W032473/1) has been supported through the UKRI Strategic Priority Fund as part of the wider Protecting Citizens Online programme and is associated with the National Research Centre on Privacy, Harm Reduction and Adversarial Influence Online (REPHRAIN). </p>
