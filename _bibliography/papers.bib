  title = {Privacy {Pitfalls} of {Online} {Service} {Terms} and {Conditions}: a {Hybrid} {Approach} for {Classiﬁcation} and {Summarization}},
  abstract = {Verbose and complicated legal terminology in online service terms and conditions (T\&C) means that users typically don’t read these documents before accepting the terms of such unilateral service contracts. With such services becoming part of mainstream digital life, highlighting Terms of Service (ToS) clauses that impact on the collection and use of user data and privacy are important concerns. Advances in text summarization can help to create informative and concise summaries of the terms, but existing approaches geared towards news and microblogging corpora are not directly applicable to the ToS domain, which is hindered by a lack of T\&C-relevant resources for training and evaluation. This paper presents a ToS model, developing a hybrid extractive-classiﬁer-abstractive pipeline that highlights the privacy and data collection/use-related sections in a ToS document and paraphrases these into concise and informative sentences. Relying on signiﬁcantly less training data (4313 training pairs) than previous representative works (287,226 pairs), our model outperforms extractive baselines by at least 50\% in ROUGE-1 score and 54\% in METEOR score. The paper also contributes to existing community efforts by curating a dataset of online service T\&C, through a developed web scraping tool.},

  abstract = {Sarcasm is prevalent in all corners of social media, posing many challenges within Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly for sentiment analysis. Sarcasm detection remains a largely unsolved problem in many NLP tasks due to its contradictory and typically derogatory nature as a figurative language construct. With recent strides in NLP, many pre-trained language models exist that have been trained on data from specific social media platforms, i.e., Twitter. In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of multiple sarcasm detection datasets using machine and deep learning models. We create two new datasets - a manually annotated gold standard Sarcasm Annotated Dataset (SAD) and a Silver-Standard Sarcasm-annotated Dataset (S3D). Using a combination of existing sarcasm datasets with SAD, we train a sarcasm detection model over a social-media domain pre-trained language model, BERTweet, which yields an F1-score of 78.29\%. Using an Ensemble model with an underlying majority technique, we further label S3D to produce a weakly supervised dataset containing over 100, 000 tweets. We publicly release all the code, our manually annotated and weakly supervised datasets, and fine-tuned models for further research.},

The sending of unwanted junk messages by unknown contacts via WhatsApp remains understudied by researchers, in part because of the end-to-end encryption offered by the platform. We address this gap by studying junk messaging on a multilingual dataset of 2.6M messages sent to 5K public WhatsApp groups in India. We characterise both junk content and senders. We find that nearly 1 in 10 messages is unwanted content sent by junk senders, and a number of unique strategies are employed to reflect challenges faced on WhatsApp, e.g., the need to change phone numbers regularly. We finally experiment with on-device classification to automate the detection of junk, whilst respecting end-to-end encryption.},

We propose GraphNLI, a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses graph walk techniques to capture the wider context of a discussion thread in a principled fashion.

This paper attempts to address this gap in the literature by looking at the top 100 Alexa websites for over 25 years from the Internet Archive or the “Wayback Machine”, archive.org. We study the changes in popularity, from Geocities and Yahoo! in the mid-to-late 1990s to the likes of Google, Facebook, and Tiktok of today. We also look at different categories of websites and their popularity over the years and find evidence for the decline in popularity of news and education-related websites, which have been replaced by streaming media and social networking sites. We explore the emergence and relative prevalence of different MIME-types (text vs. image vs. video vs. javascript and json) and study whether the use of text on the Internet is declining.},

  abstract = {The "Decentralised Web" (DW) is an evolving concept, which encompasses technologies aimed at providing greater transparency and openness on the web. The DW relies on independent servers (aka instances) that mesh together in a peer-to-peer fashion to deliver a range of services (e.g. micro-blogs, image sharing, video streaming). However, toxic content moderation in this decentralised context is challenging. This is because there is no central entity that can define toxicity, nor a large central pool of data that can be used to build universal classifiers. It is therefore unsurprising that there have been several high-profile cases of the DW being misused to coordinate and disseminate harmful material. Using a dataset of 9.9M posts from 117K users on Pleroma (a popular DW microblogging service), we quantify the presence of toxic content. We find that toxic content is prevalent and spreads rapidly between instances. We show that automating per-instance content moderation is challenging due to the lack of sufficient training data available and the effort required in labelling. We therefore propose and evaluate ModPair, a model sharing system that effectively detects toxic content, gaining an average per-instance macro-F1 score 0.89.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed growing consolidation of web operations. For example, the majority of web traffic now originates from a few organizations, and even micro-websites often choose to host on large pre-existing cloud infrastructures. In response to this, the “Decentralized Web” attempts to distribute ownership and operation of web services more evenly. This paper describes the design and implementation of the largest and most widely used Decentralized Web platform — the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) — an open-source, content-addressable peer-to-peer network that provides distributed data storage and delivery. IPFS has millions of daily content retrievals and already underpins dozens of thirdparty applications. This paper evaluates the performance of IPFS by introducing a set of measurement methodologies that allow us to uncover the characteristics of peers in the IPFS network. We reveal presence in more than 2700 Autonomous Systems and 152 countries, the majority of which operate outside large central cloud providers like Amazon or Azure. We further evaluate IPFS performance, showing that both publication and retrieval delays are acceptable for a wide range of use cases. Finally, we share our datasets, experiences and lessons learned.},

The standards development process followed by the IETF is open and consensus-driven, but is inherently both a social and political activity, and latent inﬂuential structures might exist within the community. Exploring and understanding these structures is essential to ensuring the IETF’s resilience and openness. We use network analysis to explore the social graph of IETF participants, based on public email discussions and co-author relationships, and the inﬂuence of key contributors. We show that a small core of participants dominates: the top 10\% contribute almost half (43.75\%) of the emails and come from a relatively small group of organisations. On the other hand, we also ﬁnd that inﬂuence has become relatively more decentralised with time. IETF participants also propose and work on drafts that are either adopted by a working group for further reﬁnement or get rejected at an early stage. Using the social graph features combined with email text features, we perform regression analysis to understand the effect of user inﬂuence on the success of new work being adopted by the IETF. Our ﬁndings shed useful insights into the behavior of participants across time, correlation between inﬂuence and success in draft adoption, and the signiﬁcance of afﬁliated organisations in the authorship of drafts.},

  abstract = {Laws like GDPR in the EU mandated all websites operating in their jurisdiction to obtain users’ informed consent before tracking those users and collecting their data. Today, this is achieved by showing users cookie consent notices. These notices are ubiquitous (often permeating the geographical boundaries of GDPR enforcement), even though their exact user interface (UI) designs vary. These designs are provided by Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) to different websites, effectively resulting in a handful of cookie consent notice designs being shown to a majority of internet users. Naturally, not all designs are uniformly liked by the users. Thus the first step of improving cookie consent notice UI design and moving to a better consent mechanism is to understand whether users prefer one design over another in the wild and why. To answer these questions, in this work, we conduct an in the wild comparative survey with 98 participants where 64.3\% of the participants were from the EU (i.e., GDPR is applicable), and the rest were self-reported to be located outside of the EU. In this within-subjects study, our participants ranked five different popular cookie consent UI designs (leveraged by CMPs used in Alexa UK Top500 websites) and gave rationale for their choices. Our analysis found that the slider design is statistically significantly better ranked (and thus most liked) than all other designs. Our further qualitative analysis identifies and unpacks five key design factors which impacted our participants’ liking/disliking of consent notice UI designs (as captured by the ranks given to these designs by our participants) – ease of use, amount of information, customisability, decision-making time, and clarity/transparency. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of our findings on future cookie consent notice UI designs.},

Various existing optimisation techniques target LoRa characteristics such as collision rate, fairness, and power consumption. This paper proposes a machine learning ensemble to reduce the total distance between devices and improve the average received signal strength, resulting in improved network throughput, the scalability of LoRaWAN, and the cost of networks. The ensemble consists of a constrained K-Means clustering algorithm, a regression model to validate new gateway locations and a Neural network to estimate signal strength based on the location of the devices. Results show a mean distance reduction of 51\% with an RSSI improvement of 3\% when maintaining the number of gateways, also achieving a distance reduction of 27\% and predicting an RSSI increase of 1\% after clustering with 50\% of the number of gateways.},

While automation can overcome such limitations, spatial and temporal discontinuities in time-lapse movies render methods such as 3D object segmentation and tracking difficult. Here, we present SpinX, a framework for reconstructing gaps between successive image frames by combining deep learning and mathematical object modeling. By incorporating expert feedback through selective annotations, SpinX identifies subcellular structures, despite confounding neighbor-cell information, non-uniform illumination, and variable fluorophore marker intensities. The automation and continuity introduced here allows the precise 3D tracking and analysis of spindle movements with respect to the cell cortex for the first time. We demonstrate the utility of SpinX using distinct spindle markers, cell lines, microscopes, and drug treatments. In summary, SpinX provides an exciting opportunity to study spindle dynamics in a sophisticated way, creating a framework for step changes in studies using time-lapse microscopy.},

The extracted patterns offer precise deﬁnition of activity levels associated with speciﬁc lifestyles and showcase that users’ behaviors are a combination of several lifestyles, in contrast to traditional circadian topology theory which classiﬁes individuals to a speciﬁc temporal pattern.
